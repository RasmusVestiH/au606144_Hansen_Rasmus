For this assignment I have tried to make it work in the terminal. 
This means that you will have to run a terminal and set the directory to assignment3 
After this you can call the environment assignment3env with the code: source assignment3env/bin/activate
Then you can pip install the requirements.txt with "pip install -r requirements.txt"
Then use cd src/ to get to the folder in which my script is placed. By running this with python in the terminal in the src directory as:
python edge_detection.py 
You should have the cropped and letter images in the output folder. 
Hope this works. Have a nice day! :)
